* BackPropagationNN.py - Basic MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) network, adapted and from the book ['Programming Collective Intelligence'](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596529321.do) Consists of three layers: input, hidden and output. The sizes of input and output must match data the size of hidden is user defined when initializing the network. The algorithm has been generalized to be used on any dataset.
